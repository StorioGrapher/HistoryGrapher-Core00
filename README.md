====

HistoryGrapher-Core00 is a project for Proof of Concepts

## Summary

When you record, manage and design historical data.

## Concepts of HistoryGrapher

### Better then Spreadsheet

I had maintained historical data with Apple's Numbers, Microsoft Excel, and Google Sheets.
It provides almost every features that I need, but not comfortable to maintain & design.

* Hard to add a event with new or updated rules(column, etc)
* Hard to shift a event
* Hard to shift events by group
* Hard to update relevant events with modified without script programming

### Better then Calendar

Also, I had maintained scheduled events with Google Calendar.
It provide a few features that I need, but are uncomfortable and not enough.

* Can't shift events by group
* Can't shift a event under a condition

## Focus of HistoryGrapher-Core00

* Interpret of SGript
* Make a event(spool) movable and adaptive

## Features

* Data format
* Monitoring UI
  * Will be parted out as debug and Server-Client protocol
* Script Interpreter
* Event Controller

## Features would be implemented some times later

* Describing very complex time flow
